/*
	When creating this app I used a few references to get started
	
	First of all I created a 3d mesh from an open source map found at:
	- https://bananas.openttd.org/en/heightmap/

	For the modeling process I used Blender - found some great tutorials on youtube, f.x:
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V75_tXdwxxw

	For references and getting started on ThreeJS:
	- https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Getting-Started
	- http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_geometry_terrain.html
	- http://codepen.io/nireno/pen/cAoGI
	- http://aerotwist.com/tutorials/creating-particles-with-three-js/
	
	Code used from other sources can be seen in the /thirdparty folder as well
	as some of it being in the Visualization Controller.
